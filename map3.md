# Missing People in San Diego County by Age Range

Over the last five years, San Diego County reported approximately 8,300 missing people across all young age groups (0-17), as shown in the top figure. Youth aged 13-17 make up the largest group by far, accounting for about 7,600 cases, or nearly 90% of the total missing youth shown here.Other notable groups include those aged 25-34 (2,000 cases) and 35-44 (1,400 cases), with smaller yet still concerning numbers among older adults and younger children. The accompanying map shows that cases are not evenly distributed. Larger circles indicate neighborhoods with higher reports of missing people. For instance, Kearny Mesa stands out with nearly 4,000 cases, most commonly in the 13-17 age range. Other dense clusters are visible in Downtown, National City, and parts of Chula Vista.

Notable insights were that teenagers (13-17) are overwhelmingly the most at-risk group, suggesting patterns linked to youth vulnerabilities such as running away, family conflict, or possible trafficking risks. And, central and southern neighborhoods, including Kearny Mesa, Downtown San Diego, and surrounding areas, are hotspots for missing person reports.
