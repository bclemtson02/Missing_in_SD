## Bret Clemetson
Hi my name is Bret Clemetson, I am from and currently live in Los Angeles County. A few hobbies are golfing with friends and going to the park with my 13 month old son. I really enjoy watching, playing, and analyzing sports. That is why I am taking this program. I want to be able to analyze data within sports this course can help with analyzing off field data and being able to compare small and large markets.

I also enjoy gaining knowledge through audiobooks. I commute to work for about 7 hours every week. This is a great time to listen and learn instead of just driving. Recently I have listed to the Alchemist and Green Lights. I highly recommend audiobooks or podcasts for other commuters! 

I worked with the CSUF softball team for three seasons and hope this Master's program helps my career advancement and lands me a job in an MLB team's front office. I currently work as a Supply Chain Analyst.

## Tallal Moshrif
Hello everyone,

My name is Tallal Moshrif (pronounced Tall-All), and I’m from Glendora, a small city just east of Los Angeles.

I currently work as a Porsche Ambassador, so life stays pretty busy with sales and client engagement. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, traveling when I can, and hanging out with my two French Bulldogs.

I’m taking this class as part of the Big Data Analytics program, and I’m excited to build new skills with the technologies and tools we’ll be exploring.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or collaborate!

Thank you!

## Kasey Vo

Hello everyone, my name is Kasey (Kay-see) and I am originally from San Diego, California, but currently live in Austin Texas. In Austin, I love to explore new food places (since theres a lot of "interesting" food options here), and I love to go on long walks in downtown Austin. There is always something new to explore in Austin, so I usually never get bored around this part of the city. The reason I am taking this class as a requirement for my BDA courses, but I still see that this course will be very useful in the industry!
