## Kasey Vo

Hello everyone, my name is Kasey (Kay-see) and I am originally from San Diego, California, but currently live in Austin Texas. In Austin, I love to explore new food places (since theres a lot of "interesting" food options here), and I love to go on long walks in downtown Austin. There is always something new to explore in Austin, so I usually never get bored around this part of the city. The reason I am taking this class as a requirement for my BDA courses, but I still see that this course will be very useful in the industry!
