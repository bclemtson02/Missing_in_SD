# Problem Statement
This project explores patterns of missing people in San Diego County through web mapping, focusing on demographics and underlying social factors. Young people, especially teens, are heavily overrepresented in missing person cases, both locally and nationally. Nearly 1 in 20 adolescents run away each year, often due to family conflict, mental health struggles, or unstable home environments (Gambon & Gewirtz O’Brien, 2020). In San Diego, our data shows that teens aged 13–17 make up almost 90% of missing youth cases, with concentrations in central and southern neighborhoods.

These hotspots often overlap with areas of high student poverty, underscoring how economic hardship increases the risk of youth going missing (Tyler & Bersani, 2008 as cited by Gambon & Gewirtz O’Brien, 2020). Once away from home, teens face heightened risks of exploitation and trafficking, an issue affecting up to 38,000 people locally each year (Chisolm-Straker et al., 2019).

By using interactive web maps, this project highlights these spatial patterns to identify where targeted prevention and outreach is needed most.
