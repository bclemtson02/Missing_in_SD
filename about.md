# Project Summary
This project aims to map and analyze missing persons data in San Diego County over
the past five years, using records obtained from the San Diego Police Department
through a public records request. The dataset includes demographic details and case
descriptions, such as whether the case involved human trafficking or youth runaways.
Our primary goal is to visualize where individuals were last reported missing and identify
geographic patterns across the county. By layering this data with San Diego Census
tract shapefiles, we will provide additional context using socioeconomic indicators like
poverty and income levels, education attainment, and housing stability. This spatial
approach allows us to explore the correlations between these structural, systematic
factors and rates of disappearance.

We will also use the demographic data provided to highlight racial disparities,
particularly the overrepresentation of Black and Hispanic individuals among missing
persons cases in the region. We plan to review academic literature and community-
based reports to explore the root causes and systemic factors that may contribute to
these disparities.

The projectâ€™s overall objective is to raise public awareness, support data-informed policy
conversations, and provide a tool for journalists, advocates, and researchers to explore
spatial and demographic trends in missing persons cases. The final output will include a
publicly accessible web map and summary findings.
