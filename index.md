# Welcome to Our Group Project!
We need to create a quick 2 liner here that says who we are and what we are going to do.

Ex. We are a group of 4 students from SDSU GC. This is our final project for GEOG 583. We will be using various maps (get more specific here)
to create a visual of the current issue involving Missing Persons in SD County. 

Our data was received from the Police Station via request.
The [*Missing Person's Data*](assets/files/Cleaned_Missing_Persons_Data_with_Coordinates.xlsx) contains important demographic information such as race, age, and gender.
It also includes the reason for the person going missing as well as the locations.
