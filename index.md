We are a group of 4 students from SDSU GC. This is our final project for GEOG 583. For our final project in GEOG 583, we are using ArcGIS Dashboards and Tableau to create visualizations that highlight the ongoing issue of Missing Persons in San Diego County.

Our data was obtained from the local police department through a formal request. The [*Missing Person's Data*](assets/files/Cleaned_Missing_Persons_Data_with_Coordinates.xlsx) includes key demographic information such as race, age, and gender, as well as the reported reason for each disappearance and associated location details.
