# Missing People by Year and Month

From 2019 to 2023, reported missing person cases in San Diego more than doubled, rising from about 1,200 cases in 2019 to a peak of 3,200 in 2023. The sharpest increases occurred between 2019 and 2021, with cases climbing by roughly 1,500 each year. Missing cases then slowed, with smaller rises into 2022 and 2023. In 2024, the trend reversed slightly, dropping to around 2,900 cases, a modest decline of about 9% from the previous year. Overall, this pattern highlights a substantial rise in missing person reports over the five-year period, followed by a slight decrease in the most recent year.

The number of reported missing people tends to be higher in the spring and summer months, especially April, May, July, and August, where counts are around 1,300 to 1,400 cases. May and April consistently show some of the highest levels, reaching close to 1.4k cases, matched again in August and September. There is a noticeable dip in December, dropping to about 1.1k cases, the lowest point in the year.Slightly lower numbers also appear in February and November, each around 1.2k cases.

Overall, missing person cases appear to peak in late spring and summer, decline in late fall and winter, and then start to climb again at the beginning of the year. This pattern may reflect seasonal or social factors, such as school breaks, holidays, or weather-related activities that could influence when people go missing.

The dashboard features a map that displays clusters of missing people by year. Itâ€™s interactive with the year-to-year line chart, clicking on a specific year updates the map to show the distribution of missing cases across neighborhoods. You can also click on individual clusters to see a summary of the cases in that area. It also includes a line chart for the number of missing people by month from 2019-2024.
