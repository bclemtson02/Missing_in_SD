# Final Thoughts
One of the things that worked really well in this project was using interactive maps and dashboards to actually see what was going on. Once we started breaking the data down by age, race, gender, and ZIP code, the patterns became clearer. Teens aged 13 to 17 made up the majority of missing youth cases, and ZIP codes like 92123 kept coming up across different groups. Tableau and ArcGIS gave us a way to bring in additional layers, like student poverty data, and compare that to where people were going missing.

There were some challenges too. The original dataset had ZIP codes from outside San Diego, duplicate records, and missing values that took time to clean. We also hit ArcGIS credit limits, which forced us to switch from ZIP-based mapping to using latitude and longitude coordinates with clustering. It worked, but it added more steps to the process. Another issue was dealing with inflated activity numbers caused by repeated entries tied to the same case ID. We had to be careful to show those patterns without misrepresenting the data.

What stood out the most was how much more you can learn when you map the data. It’s one thing to see the numbers in a table, but the visual patterns really helped everything click. Seeing how missing youth cases lined up with poverty levels made the issue feel more real. The gender and race breakdowns by neighborhood also led to new questions we didn’t expect when we started.

If we had more time, we’d add more context, like school locations, shelter access, or even police beat data - to better understand what’s going on in each neighborhood. We’d also work on building cleaner dashboards that could be shared with local organizations already doing this kind of work. This project gave us a solid base to build from, and there’s definitely more we could explore.
