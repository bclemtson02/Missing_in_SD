# Final Thoughts
This project successfully used mapping and dashboards to uncover spatial patterns of missing people in San Diego County, showing clear overlaps with areas of high poverty and highlighting demographic disparities. What worked well was our ability to integrate multiple datasets, missing person reports, Census poverty data, and neighborhood boundaries and build interactive visualizations that allowed us to explore where and among whom these issues are most concentrated. The maps and dashboards made it easy to see that teens, particularly in central and southern neighborhoods with higher poverty levels, are disproportionately represented.

However, we faced several challenges. A major limitation was time; we were not able to perform deeper analyses or explore additional social factors, such as income disparity, education levels.

Through this process, we learned how powerful spatial analysis can be in bringing attention to underlying social and economic issues, and how vital it is to look beyond overall counts to see who is most affected and where. Our site meets our goals by visually demonstrating the intersections between missing youth, poverty, and neighborhood characteristics, which can help inform targeted prevention and outreach.
