# Missing Young People in SD and Student Poverty Levels (Embedded Map)

This map uses Census data on poverty by school enrollment for people aged 3 and over to highlight San Diego tracts where more students are living in poverty (shown in darker blue).  
When overlaid with data on missing children ages 13â€“17, it reveals that areas with higher student poverty often overlap with places where children are reported missing or last seen.
